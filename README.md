## The Colosseum

A personal project created by Justin Man<br>
<br>
My motivations for this project were to develop my skills in Fullstack development, using React and GraphQL (through Apollo)<br>

## To Start

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# to start client

npm run server
# or 
yarn server
# to start the server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the client.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the Apollo server.
